## Note
### Sandbox Deployment
I tried the method of Deploying Hortonworks Sandbox on VirtualBox, but with a limited 8 RAM on Mac and other constraints of this method, I decided built the Apache Ambari based on [Deploying Hortonworks Sandbox on Microsoft Azure](https://zh.hortonworks.com/tutorial/sandbox-deployment-and-install-guide/section/4/).

[Here]() are the steps of **creating hortonworks data platform andbox in Azure**, which are slightly different from the website.

I followed this video to install Putty on Mac. [How to install Putty on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rblQ4y9coGg)
